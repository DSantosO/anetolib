 * The ANETO Library
 *
 * Project homepage: https://github.com/DSantosO/anetolib
 * Copyright (c) 2017 Daniel Santos-Olivan and Carlos F. Sopuerta
 * ANETO is under GNU General Public License ("GPL").
 *
 * The ANETO (Arbitrary precisioN solvEr with pseudo-specTral methOds) library's
 * main purpose is to provide a tool to perform simple one-dimensional problems
 * or evolution ones with the Method of lines with Arbitrary Precision using
 * Pseudo-Spectral Collocation methods (PSC).
 *
 * The exponential convergence of spectral methods makes them the best option to go beyond
 * the standard double precision (64-bits).
 * For this precision, maximum accuracy is usually reached with a very low number of
 * discretization points so it is not that computational expensive to go further.
 *
 * The classes implemented here can be used with arbitrary data types allowing us to
 * control the accuracy of our numerical computations until the level we need / can
 * computationally afford.
 *
 * A paper with a basic review of PSC methods and showing some of the possibilities
 * of the library will be published soon.
 *
 * For comments, questions or suggestions about new functionalities, the user can
 * contact anetolib@gmail.com
 *
 * The authors thank Lluís Gesa and Víctor Martín for suggestions and
 * improvements in the code of the library.
 *
 *******************************************************************************************************
 * Using the Library
 *
 * All the functionalities of this library are implemented as template classes in the
 * header files included in the folder aneto/ so in order to be used in
 * your program is enough to tell the compiler to included this folder or
 * to copy them into an existing include folder.
 * The ANETO library need the standard C++ library and the
 * Eigen3 library for Linear Algebra that can be downloaded from
 * http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
 *
 *
 *******************************************************************************************************
 * Quick Test
 *
 * For a quick test of the library, the script tests.sh can be used.
 * Just:
		./tests-sh build
		./tests-sh run
 *
 * If any of the previous fails, check the next section for a full option building.
 *
 *
 *******************************************************************************************************
 * Full Test
 *
 * The current library includes some tests that can be execute in order to
 * check the correct behaviour of the library or to be used as an use examples.
 * The first thing is to compile the test executable. Located in the ANETO folder, this can be done as:
 *
		cd build/
		cmake ../.
		make tests
 *
 * The examples use standard types and MPFR C++ a wrapp-up created by
 * Pavel Holoborodko (http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/mpfr/).
 * MPFR C++ is included with the examples but GNU's MPFR library (http://www.mpfr.org) is needed.
 * This should be available in the repositories of most GNU/Linux distributions and can be also downloaded from its website.
 * If it is not available an error will show it during the cmake building process.
 * Boost C++ libraries (http://www.boost.org) are also used and need to be installed.
 * If any of the boost modules needed are not available an error will show it during the cmake building process.
 * The test also check some of the functions with the non-standard quadruple precision 'quadmath'.
 * The use of this library can be disable by adding '-DQUAD=OFF' as an cmake argument.
 * In addition, some functions are also checked with the QD library types dd_real (32 digits) and qd_real (64 digits).
 * The headers and the static library needs to be installed in a folder available for the compiler. The library can
 * be downloaded at http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/.
 * The use of this library can be disable by adding '-DQD=OFF' as an cmake argument.
 *
 * Once the tests are compiled they can check most of the functions of the library and can
 * be executed just by:
 *
		./tests
 *
 * For a complete output of the tests the verbose option '-v' can be enabled.
 * This option will generate files for some of the tests.
 *
 * If a single test is wanted it also can be executed with the option 't'.
 * The following are available:
 *
		./tests -t singledom_derivatives
		./tests -t singledom_integral_comparison
		./tests -t singledom_integral_LR
		./tests -t multidom_derivative_dual
		./tests -t multidom_integral_comparison
		./tests -t multidom_integral_LR
		./tests -t root_finding
		./tests -t interpolation
 *
 * Also, only singledomain or multidomain test can be executed by:
		./tests -t singledom
		./tests -t multidom

 *
 * Aside from the predefined one, the user can also change the number of domains/points for checking
 * different grid configuration. '-D' change the domains '-N' change the points per domain and
 * '-S' change the points for single domain tests. In some tests, the user can also change the digits
 * precision with '-p'. All of this options only will be visible in the verbose mode and will not
 * impact in the default checks.
 *
 *
 *******************************************************************************************************
 * OpenMP Support
 *
 * The parallel support via OpenMP (http://www.openmp.org/) is yet experimental.
 * Now it is available in the multidomain for the integral and normal derivative but
 * it is not assured a perfect behaviour.
 * If it present any problem or one just one to execute the library sequencially
 * it can be compiled without OpenMP adding -DOMP=OFF in the test cmake or adding directly -DOMP=0
 * as compilation option.
 *
 *
 *******************************************************************************************************
 * Documentation
 *
 * The manual in pdf can be found in the doc/ folder.

 * The documentation of ANETO library can be generated by the script
 *           ./documentation
 *
 * For a proper compilation, it needs Doxygen generator (www.doxygen.org).
 * By default, a HTML version and a LaTeX pdf will be generated, so \b pdflatex
 * and the proper packages needs to be installed.
 *
 * Doxygen options can be changed in the configuration file 'Doxfile'.
